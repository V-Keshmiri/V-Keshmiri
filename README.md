# This is Vahid's profile.
Vahid is a solution maker! What is it mean? It's simple... no matter what industry or field is a problem source, you explain it to Vahid, and if he accept the challenge, he will find a solution tailored with your limitations.
Let's explain it with some real world case studies that Vahid solved:
## Problem #1: Pixel-by Pixel Calibration of Modular Displays (LED Signs, LED Walls, stc.)
### Problem:
Modular Displays, specially outdoor ones, starting changing their colors after a while, and this decoloring is not the same for all pixels. So after a while, the content plays on them in a way that not very satisfying and sometimes diturb the view so much that it is better to be off!
### Solution:
Vahid comes with the idea of calibrating them pixel-bypixel in a way they look like a brand new display! To do so, he made a few experiment, define what gears neede, and also made a calibration software that is compatible with every single screen! 
This is the first time in display industry that a software can calibrate every display, and there is no other solution that can calibrate a display at the site without dark rooms and other special treatments these kind of procee needs.
