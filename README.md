# This is Vahid's profile.
Vahid is a Puzzle Lover, an extraordinary Problem Solver (solution maker), and  a Data Scientist with extensive background in ML, AI, Machine Vision, and specially ANN.

Let's explain it with some real world case studies that Vahid solved:
## Problem #1: Digital Billboards' Image Degradation
### Problem:
Out-of-Home (OOH) Digital Displays, specially outdoor ones, suffer from immage degradation due to environmental factors, such as UV exposure, Dirt, Ambient Temperature, and harsh weather, face with issues such as Color disparity and brightness mismatch. A display normally has lifespan of +15 years, but due to image degradation, they need to be replaced after 3-5 years, wasting millions of dollars and poluting our planets.
### Solution:
Vahid used AI and made a SaaS solution for this problem, matching color and brightness of every pixel of the display, enhance its image quality better than the brand new one [(click here for the results)](https://blueglamour.co/gallery/).
