# This is Vahid's profile.
Vahid is a Puzzle Lover, an extraordinary Problem Solver (solution maker), and  a Data Scientist with extensive background in ML, AI, Machine Vision, and specially ANN.

Let's explain it with some real world case studies that Vahid solved:
## Problem #1: Digital Billboards' Image Degradation
### Problem:
Out-of-Home (OOH) Digital Displays, specially outdoor ones, suffer from immage degradation due to environmental factors, such as UV exposure, Dirt, Ambient Temperature, and harsh weather, face with issues such as Color disparity and brightness mismatch. A display normally has lifespan of +15 years, but due to image degradation, they need to be replaced after 3-5 years, wasting millions of dollars and poluting our planets.
### Solution:
Vahid used AI and made a SaaS solution for this problem, matching color and brightness of every pixel of the display, enhance its image quality better than the brand new one [(See the pictures here)](https://blueglamour.co/gallery/).
## Problem #2: Undergraound Mines Wireless Communication
### Problem:
It is impossible to communicate with the rescue teams responding to underground mines' accidents, due to lack of wireless network there.
### Solution:
After a lot of research, Vahid funds out that the wireless networks needs to be designed specifically for every tunnel according to their shapes, wall materials, and environment, and still very vulnerable and super expensive. The reson for that is Echo of the waves in these environments. Vahid trained an ML to find the right waves and ignore Echos, made the very first Expandable Underground Wireless Network, takling a 90-year-old problem in Mine Industry.
## Problem #3: Stock Market Prediction Using Social Media's Quantitative Data
### Problem:
Using social medias' data was always been in interest of stock exchange market, but sentiment analysis are too riscky to rely on for big trades.
### Solution:
Vahid comes with the idea of quantifying social media impact on stockmarket and made the very first market prediction tools using quantitative data of social media instead of sentiment analysis.
